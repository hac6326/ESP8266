# ESP8266
The ESP8266! A powerful and popular microcontroller that has become a staple in the IoT and hacking communities.  As a hacker, you can use the ESP8266 to create a wide range of projects, from Wi-Fi hacking tools to IoT devices that can be used for reconnaissance or exploitation.

Setting up an ESP8266 board can be a bit involved, but don't worry, I'll guide you through the process.

# Captive.bin:

captive.bin is a firmware binary that allows the ESP8266 to create a captive portal. A captive portal is a web page that is displayed to users when they connect to a WiFi network, typically to authenticate or agree to terms of service.

When an ESP8266 is flashed with captive.bin, it becomes a WiFi access point that redirects any connected devices to a specific web page. This can be useful for various applications, such as:

WiFi setup: Allow users to configure WiFi settings for the ESP8266 device.
Authentication: Require users to authenticate or provide credentials before accessing the internet.
Information display: Display information, such as a welcome message or terms of service, to users who connect to the network.
To use captive.bin, you typically need to:

Flash the captive.bin firmware to the ESP8266.
Configure the captive portal settings using a web interface or serial commands.
Connect to the ESP8266's WiFi network using a device (e.g., smartphone, laptop).
The device will be redirected to the captive portal web page.

# Deauther.bin:

deauther.bin is a firmware binary that allows the ESP8266 to perform WiFi deauthentication attacks. A deauthentication attack is a type of WiFi attack where a device sends a deauthentication packet to a WiFi client, causing it to disconnect from the network.

When an ESP8266 is flashed with deauther.bin, it can be used to:

Deauthenticate devices: Disconnect devices from a WiFi network by sending deauthentication packets.
Scan for WiFi networks: Scan for nearby WiFi networks and display their SSIDs and signal strengths.
Perform WiFi reconnaissance: Gather information about nearby WiFi networks, such as their channel, encryption, and device connections.
To use deauther.bin, you typically need to:

Flash the deauther.bin firmware to the ESP8266.
Configure the deauther settings using a web interface or serial commands.
Use the ESP8266 to scan for WiFi networks or deauthenticate devices.

# Hardware Requirements:

ESP8266 board (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1, or ESP-12E)
Micro-USB cable
Computer with internet connection
Breadboard and jumper wires (optional)

# Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE (or other compatible IDE, such as PlatformIO or MicroPython)
ESP8266 board drivers (depending on your operating system)
Step 1: Install the Arduino IDE

Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Step 2: Install the ESP8266 Board Drivers

Depending on your operating system, you may need to install additional drivers to connect your ESP8266 board to your computer:

Windows: Download and install the CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Driver from the Silicon Labs website: https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
Mac: No additional drivers are required.
Linux: You may need to install the cp210x driver package using your distribution's package manager.
Step 3: Connect the ESP8266 Board to Your Computer

Connect the ESP8266 board to your computer using a micro-USB cable. Make sure the board is properly connected and powered.

Step 4: Open the Arduino IDE and Select the ESP8266 Board

Open the Arduino IDE and select the ESP8266 board from the Tools menu:

Board: ESP8266 Boards (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1, or ESP-12E)
Port: Select the serial port corresponding to your ESP8266 board (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux or COM3 on Windows)
Step 5: Install the ESP8266 Library

In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries... and search for "ESP8266". Install the "ESP8266 WiFi" library by ESP8266 Community.

# Upload 

open this https://esp.huhn.me/

Connect esp8266 using a cable to system

click connect 

Then upload the.bin file which you want to use

After that remove it and  start the attack
